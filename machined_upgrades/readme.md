*** Files generated with the Solidworks Pack and Go feature ***

Important things to note:
- All off the shlef parts used in the main assembly are included in the 'stock_parts'.
- All files in the root directory have been modified for use in this custom machined carriage assembly. 
- These files are a work in progress and are subject to change at any time. 
- I have also included my modified z motor plates designed to be machined out of 1/4" 6061 aluminum. 


Feel free to give me any feedback both positive and negative!
